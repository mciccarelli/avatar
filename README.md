#### Running That

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

#### Supported Langs
The plugin supports the `less`, `scss` and `css` file extensions. It is possible to add support for another pre-processor by creating a function to compile the code. In the example we use `sass` as our css pre-processor

To edit the types you need to go to `.babelrc`
